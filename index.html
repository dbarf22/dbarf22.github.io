        <p>
          Welcome to my website! I am a senior UGA Computer Science major and
          Film Studies minor graduating in May 2026. Right now, my interests lie
          in creating things that have immediate positive impacts on people's
          lives. Whether it's through services designed to meet people's
          accessibility needs, sites that allow people to express themselves and
          share what they love, or experiences that provide meaningful
          interactions, I strive to create things that I think are genuinely
          useful and enjoyable for people. I have experience in full-stack
          development, and I love learning new technologies by taking on new
          projects.

              <h3>Media Scheduler</h3>
              <p>
                A lightweight media scheduling app built with Python and
                Alpine.JS. This app is designed to facilitate automated playback
                of movies and TV episodes to a device running Jellyfin. This is
                intended to allow caregivers to schedule media playback for
                individuals who are otherwise unable to use or navigate
                streaming interfaces on their own.

                browse recommendations from other users and read what they had

                A small, interactive connection-focused experiment made with
                Godot and Supabase, and hosted on itch.io. Users can navigate
                around a virtual garden and anonymously plant flowers with
                messages attached for others to read. There are limited spots in
                the garden, and flowers expire after 24 hours.

                and showtimes, create user accounts, and handle account
                information. Front-end built with React, Tailwind CSS, and

                of their most listened to songs. Then, users can click each song
